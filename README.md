-   How to add new Item to Portfolio Page :
    1- Check if there is a <li> item with class "fillter-btn" or create it (this is for filteration / Category)
    2- create new preview div item with class "isotop-item" and corresponding "fillter-btn", change the href for the new modal for it, there are 2 IDs that you should edit
    3-Copy a modal from bottom and change its ID to the new Id ( to correspond with "isotop-item") , only modal ID , nothing to edit inside it , edit is data and meta data and links ...etc
